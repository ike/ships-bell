# Convert Ship's Bell to macOS Background Service

## Goal:
Convert the ship's bell service to run as a proper macOS background service using launchd instead of systemd.

## Current State:
- ✅ Ship's bell Python script working correctly
- ✅ Audio files playing properly
- ✅ All tests passing
- ❌ Current service file is for Linux systemd (ships-bell.service)
- ❌ Need macOS launchd plist configuration

## Research Needed:
1. **macOS launchd system**: How to create proper plist files for background services
2. **Service installation**: Where to place plist files (~/Library/LaunchAgents vs /Library/LaunchDaemons)
3. **Audio permissions**: Ensure background service can play audio in macOS
4. **User vs system service**: Determine if this should run as user agent or system daemon

## Implementation Plan:

### Phase 1: Research & Design
1. Research macOS launchd plist format and requirements
2. Determine optimal service type (LaunchAgent vs LaunchDaemon)
3. Check audio playback requirements for background services
4. Design plist configuration

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. Create macOS launchd plist file (com.user.ships-bell.plist)
2. Update/remove Linux systemd service file
3. Create installation/uninstallation scripts
4. Test service installation and operation

### Phase 3: Verification
1. Test service loads correctly with launchctl
2. Verify audio playback works in background
3. Test service starts on login/boot
4. Test service stops/starts properly
5. Verify logging works correctly

## Key Considerations:
- macOS sandboxing and audio permissions
- Service should run as user agent (not system daemon) for audio access
- Proper error handling and logging
- Easy installation/removal process
- Service should survive system restarts and user logouts
